   <td colname="col1"> <p>5-4-4 Custom calendar </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Added a 5-4-4 retail calendar as a custom calendar option. This calendar option is supported across all Adobe Analytics tools (ARB, Activity Map, Ad Hoc Analysis, Analysis Workspace, Reports &amp; Analytics) except for Data Warehouse, which does not support custom calendars. </p> <p>To illustrate: A year has 52 weeks, and divided into 4 quarters is 13 weeks per quarter. However, there are 3 months in a quarter and 13 is not divisible by three. You can put the extra week into one of the months to achieve a consistent calendar. 5-4-4 means the 1st month of the quarter has the extra week. 4-5-4 means the 2nd month has the extra week, etc. We already support 4-5-4 and 4-4-5 and now we have added support for 5-4-4. </p>
