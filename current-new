_New feature_

* Experience Manager Assets now lets you upload documents in other supported format types and [preview them using the included Document Cloud viewer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/manage-pdf-documents.html). The supported format types include TXT, RTF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, and XLSX.

_New feature available in prerelease channel_

* Experience Manager Assets now uses an improved artificial intelligence framework for image Smart Tags. This content intelligence results in better relevancy and precision of Smart Tags available to all image assets on ingestion. In addition, orientation information is populated in `cq:tags`, which enables better Search results using the Orientation filter.

_New features_

* [Adaptive Forms wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/creating-adaptive-form.html?lang=en): Experience Manager Forms provides business user friendly wizard to quickly author Adaptive Forms. The wizard has a quick tab navigation to easily select pre-configured template, styling, fields, and submission options to create an adaptive form. This release brings following improvements to the wizard:
    * Select or deselect fields: The wizard allows you to create an Adaptive Form based on JSON and Form Data Model schemas. You can now select subset of fields within a schema to include in an Adaptive Form. The selected fields are converted to corresponding Adaptive Form data capture components to quickly create the desired adaptive forms.
    * Use Static Templates: Customers with existing investments in legacy-static templates can continue their journey of cloud adoption by using static templates in the wizard to create adaptive forms. This provides additional time to customers to migrate old static templates to modern editable templates.
* [Remove hidden fields from a Document of Record (DoR) while server-side processing](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en): You can generate the document of record PDF for end users containing only those fields which were visible to them during data capture experience. Upon form submission, the server validates which fields were hidden to the end user based on submitted data and excludes from document of record for consistency.

_New features available in prerelease channel_

* **Adaptive Forms template editor** - Template editor lets you pre-define the basic structure and appearance of Adaptive Forms of an organization. This release brings following improvements to the template editor:
    * **[Form Data Model in template editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/creating-adaptive-form.html?lang=en#edit-form-model-properties-of-an-adaptive-form-edit-form-model)** - You can associate a Form Data Model schema to an Adaptive Form template in the template editor.

    * **[Document of Record in template editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en#document-of-record-support-in-adaptive-form-editor-dor-support-in-adaptiveform)** - You can now standardize Document of Record generation for all forms created using a template. This ability helps enhance compliance and standardization for organization requirements.

You can now create a new Adaptive Form or embed an existing Adaptive Form while remaining on AEM Sites page.
